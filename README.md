## Simulation using HLA standard with Portico implementation https://porticoproject.org/

Project simulates taxi rides between specified number of regions over one day (24h).
Simulation can be configured by changing included parameters. Simulation generates simple statistics which estimates number of rides in day and approximates number of needed extra taxis so passengers queues in regions wouldn't be needed.
